Node dependencies:
Libraries: 
    Javascript engine: a library that takes Javascript code and executes it.
        currently using V8 Engine, which is written in C++
        many options for Javascript engines.
        V8 is also used for the Chrome browser
    Async code handler: a library that implements the node.js event loop and all of the async behaviours of the platform
        node uses LibUV, written in C.

node's thread is a v8 call stack[Thread]

The call Stack[single thread]
LibUV[4 thread]
underlying OS

nodejs uses CommonJS module system
modules:    1. core modules come with node.js 2. npm modules installed. 3. user created modules

Definition:
    Thread: smallest sequence of programmed instructions to be executed [to do list]
    a thread is within a node process, within which is the order of events
    nodejs is single threaded process always

    LibUV: a tool that enforces an async event-driven style of programming
    core job: provides event loop

    Event Loop: allows node.js to perform non-blocking I/O (despite Javascript being singl threaded)
    by offloading opertions to the sytem kernel whenever possible

    setImmediate(cb): event loop method: special timer that runs in a separate phase of event loop[check]

    process.nextTick(cb): event loop method: runs after current operation on JS stack runs to completion,
    and before event loop is allowed to continue

    Module: functionality system organzed in one or more files. can be reused easily by requiring it

    Module Loader: a tool that imports a module to the current process.
